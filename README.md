Related [Blogpost](https://blog.sunggwanchoi.com/eng-uuid-shellcode-execution/)

This repo contains PoC for UUID shellcode execution using C# and DInvoke. The idea, technique, and the PoC is based on [NCCGroup RIFT's recent article](https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/01/23/rift-analysing-a-lazarus-shellcode-execution-method/), and [Jeff White's article from 2017](http://ropgadget.com/posts/abusing_win_functions.html).
 
 For shellcode to UUID String Conversion, you can use the `shellcodeToUUID.py` file, or see the following [gist](https://gist.github.com/ChoiSG/9806b5c4fe35aa24c42de87d3012d650)
