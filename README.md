This repo contains PoC for UUID shellcode execution using C# and DInvoke. The idea, technique, and the PoC is based on [NCCGroup RIFT's recent article](https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/01/23/rift-analysing-a-lazarus-shellcode-execution-method/), and [Jeff White's article from 2017](http://ropgadget.com/posts/abusing_win_functions.html).
